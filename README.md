# Final-Coding-Challenge

SudokuChecker:

You can work alone or in teams of 4. Once completed, send the code to my discord, sun-toast#7683, and type in the gather chat that you have finished. Complete it as fast as possible and include at least 3 test cases.

Given a 9 by 9 int array, check whether the sudoku has been solved. A solved sudoku will have every row contain the numbers 1-9, every column have the numbers 1-9, and every 3x3 box contain the numbers 1-9.  

You may complete this in any programming language.
